The Access category includes first and second choice antibiotics for the empirical treatment of common infectious syndromes and they should be widely available in health care settings. Antibiotics in the Watch category have a higher potential for resistance to develop and their use as first and second choice treatment should be limited. Finally, the Reserve category includes “last resort” antibiotics whose use should be reserved for specialized settings and specific cases where alternative treatments have failed. Rationale: Narrow-spectrum beta-lactams of the Access group such as amoxicillin are the preferred treatment option for most RTI and are thought to have a lower ecologic impact regarding the selection and spread of antibiotic resistance than broader-spectrum agents such as cephalosporins, macrolides or fluoroquinolones. Access group antibiotics should therefore constitute the majority of antibiotic use in the outpatient setting and overall (as outpatient use represents the vast majority of AB sales). Broader-spectrum agents classified in the Watch group should be mostly limited to their specific recommended EML uses.")

For such countries, case data reported by the NMCPs are adjusted for test positivity rate (where clinical cases are also reported), public health sector reporting rates, fever treatment-seeking rates in the private sector and the rates of not seeking treatment. Category 2 method – parasite rate-to-incidence modelling. Used for many countries in sub-Saharan Africa where the routine data is unreliable: surveillance systems do not capture all malaria cases, and data often come from the public health sector only and may not be reported consistently or may not be parasitologically confirmed. A method developed by the Malaria Atlas Project is used, which estimates cases by employing an epidemiological model of the relationship between parasite prevalence and case incidence within a geospatial framework.  Category 3 method – unadjusted routine data. This approach involves use of routine data reported by NMCPs without any adjustments. Countries for which this approach was used were Algeria, Argentina, Belize, Bhutan, Cabo Verde, China, Comoros, Costa Rica, Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, Ecuador, El Salvador, Iran (Islamic Republic of), Iraq, Malaysia, Mexico, Paraguay, Republic of Korea, Sao Tome and Principe, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Suriname, Swaziland and Thailand.

The number of people requiring PC is compared across the PC-NTDs, by age group and implementation unit (e.g. district). The largest number of people requiring PC is retained for each age group in each implementation unit. The total is considered to be a conservative estimate of the number of people requiring PC for at least one PC-NTD. Prevalence surveys determine when an NTD has been eliminated or controlled and PC can be stopped or reduced in frequency, such that the average annual number of people requiring PC is reduced. 2) Number of new cases requiring individual treatment and care for other NTDs: The number of new cases is based on country reports, whenever available, of new and known cases of Buruli ulcer, Chagas disease, cysticercosis, dengue, guinea-worm disease, echinococcosis, human African trypanosomiasis (HAT), leprosy, the leishmaniases, rabies and yaws. Where the number of people requiring and requesting surgery for PC-NTDs (e.g. trichiasis or hydrocele surgery) is reported, it can be added here. Similarly, new cases requiring and requesting rehabilitation (e.g. leprosy or lymphoedema) can be added whenever available. Populations referred to under 1) and 2) may overlap; the sum would overestimate the total number of people requiring treatment and care. The maximum of 1) or 2) is therefore retained at the lowest common implementation unit and summed to get conservative country, regional and global aggregates. By 2030, improved co-endemicity data and models will validate the trends obtained using this simplified approach.

To make the conversion into litres of pure alcohol, the alcohol content (% alcohol by volume) is as follows: Beer (barley beer 5%), Wine (grape wine 12%; must of grape 9%, vermouth 16%), Spirits (distilled spirits 40%; spirit-like 30%), and Other (sorghum, millet, maize beers 5%; cider 5%; fortified wine 17% and 18%; fermented wheat and fermented rice 9%; other fermented beverages 9%). Unrecorded alcohol consumption refers to alcohol which is not taxed and is outside the usual system of governmental control, such as home or informally produced alcohol (legal or illegal), smuggled alcohol, surrogate alcohol (which is alcohol not intended for human consumption), or alcohol obtained through cross-border shopping (which is recorded in a different jurisdiction). Unrecorded alcohol consumption was estimated as a percentage of total alcohol consumption. Country-level proportions of unrecorded alcohol consumption were estimated using a regression analysis with input data collected by WHO from different sources. Data sources included expert judgements from a WHO survey, nominal expert group Delphi surveys, and WHO STEPS surveys. Tourist consumption takes into consideration alcohol purchased and consumed by tourists to a country and alcohol purchased and consumed when people are visiting countries other than their home country.

The reported observation year corresponds to the middle of the reference period. For some surveys without data on retrospective birth histories, computation of the adolescent birth rate is based on the date of last birth or the number of births in the 12 months preceding the survey. With census data, the adolescent birth rate is computed on the basis of the date of last birth or the number of births in the 12 months preceding the enumeration. The census provides both the numerator and the denominator for the rates. In some cases, the rates based on censuses are adjusted for under- registration based on indirect methods of estimation.

The calculation of the 3.8.1 indicator requires first preparing the 14 tracer indicators so that they can be combined into the index, and then computing the index from those values.  The 14 tracer indicators are first all placed on the same scale, with 0 being the lowest value and 100 being the optimal value. For most indicators, this scale is the natural scale of measurement, e.g., the percentage of infants who have been immunized ranges from 0 to 100 percent. However, for a few indicators additional rescaling is required to obtain appropriate values from 0 to 100, as follows: • Rescaling based on a non-zero minimum to obtain finer resolution (this “stretches” the distribution across countries): prevalence of non-raised blood pressure and prevalence of nonuse of tobacco are both rescaled using a minimum value of 50%. rescaled value = (X-50)/(100-50)*100 • Rescaling for a continuous measure: mean fasting plasma glucose, which is a continuous measure (units of mmol/L), is converted to a scale of 0 to 100 using the minimum theoretical biological risk (5.1 mmol/L) and observed maximum across countries (7.1 mmol/L). rescaled value = (7.1 - original value)/(7.1-5.1)*100. Note that in countries with low malaria burden, the tracer indicator for use of insecticide-treated nets is dropped from the calculation. Maximum thresholds for rate indicators: hospital bed density and health workforce density are both capped at maximum thresholds, and values above this threshold are held constant at 100. These thresholds are based on minimum values observed across OECD countries. rescaled hospital beds per 10,000 = minimum(100, original value / 18*100)   rescaled physicians per 1,000         = minimum(100, original value / 0.9*100)   rescaled psychiatrists per 100,000 = minimum(100, original value / 1*100)   rescaled surgeons per 100,000       = minimum(100, original value / 14*100). Once all tracer indicator values are on a scale of 0 to 100, geometric means are computed within each of the four health service areas, and then a geometric mean is taken of those four values. If the value of a tracer indicator happens to be zero, it is set to 1 (out of 100) before computing the geometric mean.",

The main limitations concern age misreporting, birth omissions, misreporting the date of birth of the child, and sampling variability in the case of surveys. With respect to estimates of the adolescent birth rate among females aged 10-14 years, comparative evidence suggests that a very small proportion of births in this age group occur to females below age 12. Other evidence based on retrospective birth history data from surveys indicates that women aged 15-19 years are less likely to first births before age 15 than women from the same birth cohort when asked five years later at ages 20–24 years. The adolescent birth rate is commonly reported as the age-specific fertility rate for ages 15-19 years in the context of calculation of total fertility estimates.

However, most household surveys fail to identify the source of funding used by a household who is reporting health expenditure. In countries where there is no retrospective reimbursement of household spending on health this is not a problem. But in those countries where there is retrospective reimbursement – for example, via a contributory health insurance scheme - the amount reported by a household on health expenditures might be totally or partially reimbursed at some later point, perhaps outside the recall period of the household survey. This indicator relies on a single cut-off point to identify what constitutes ‘large health expenditure as a share of total household expenditure or income’. People just below or above such thresholds are not taken into account, which is always the problem with measures based on cut-offs. By plotting the cumulative distribution function of the health expenditure ratio, it is possible to identify the proportion of the population that is devoting any share of its household’s budget to health for any threshold. Low values of these indicators can be driven by people’s inability to spend anything at all on health. For this reason financial hardship needs to be monitored jointly with indicators of service coverage. There are other indicators used to monitor financial hardship. Within the GPW monitoring framework the definition adopted is consistent with the SDG definition of catastrophic health expenditures based on a budget share metric (indicator 3.8.2). Catastrophic health expenditures can be measured in different ways to enrich the analysis and provide policy advice tailored to individual countries. For an overview of different approaches to monitor catastrophic health expenditures using different versions of capacity-to-pay approaches (deducting for meeting basic needs) based on relevant global and regional resolutions see box 2.2 in chapter 2 of the 2017 WHO/WB Global UHC Monitoring Report as well as Cylus et al 2018 and Xu et al 2003. Financial hardship can also be monitored by estimating the proportion of the population with impoverishing health expenditure to link SDG goal 3.8 on Universal health coverage directly to the first SDG goal on poverty eradication. Different poverty lines can be used for monitoring at global, regional and country level. For more information see chapter 2 of the 2017 WHO/WB Global UHC.",

Furthermore, diverse age groups are often utilized. Willingness to discuss experiences of violence and understanding of relevant concepts may also differ according to the cultural context and this can affect reported prevalence levels. Regularity of data production: Since 1995, only some 40 countries have conducted more than one survey on violence against women. Obtaining data on violence against women is a costly and time-consuming exercise, whether they are obtained through stand-alone dedicated surveys or through modules in other surveys. Feasibility:  Psychological partner violence—which may be conceptualised differently across cultures and in different contexts—is still a Tear III sub-indicator. Since it is not yet feasible to report on psychological partner violence, this indicator currently reports on physical and/or sexual intimate partner violence only. Efforts are underway, led by WHO, to develop a global standard for measuring and reporting on psychological intimate partner violence.  Similarly, this indicator calls for global reporting of violence experienced by ever-partnered women aged 15 years and above. However, most data come from DHS, which typically sample only women aged 15-49, and there is a lack of consistency in the age range of sample populations across other country surveys. For those surveys that interview a sample of women from a different age group, the prevalence for the 15-49 age group is often published or can be calculated from available data. The global indicator therefore currently reports violence experienced by ever-partnered women and girls 15-49 years of age.

This resolution may cause limitations when considering local situations. However finer resolutions are planned for future studies. Conversion from PM10: Where measurements of PM2.5 are not available, PM10 measurements are used after conversion to PM2.5 using country or regional conversion factors. Conversion factors range between 0.3-0.8 depending on location. Localized conversion factors are likely to be more accurate but the ability to calculate them relies on localized data being available. The potential for inaccuracies in conversion factors means that model outputs for areas using large numbers of converted values may be less accurate than those based directly on measurements of PM2.5 and extra care should be taken in their interpretation. Model calibration in data-poor areas: The model produces a calibration equation for each country using country level data as a priority, with regional data being used to supplement local information for countries without ground monitoring data.
